            <h1 className='text-black tracking-[-1px] font-medium'>1. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519, Italy)</h1>
            <p >
              Often celebrated as one of the greatest minds of the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t only a painter but also a visionary inventor. His notebooks are filled with sketches of machines far ahead of his time—flying machines, armored vehicles, hydraulics, and even an early version of the helicopter. Although many of his designs were never built, his ability to imagine technology centuries before it was possible demonstrates his unmatched ingenuity. He laid a foundation for modern engineering and aeronautics.

            <h1 className='text-black tracking-[-1px] font-medium'>2. Thomas Edison (1847–1931, USA)</h1>
            <p>
              Edison is often called “America’s greatest inventor,” holding over 1,000 patents. His most famous invention, the practical incandescent light bulb, transformed society by extending productive hours beyond daylight. He also developed the phonograph (the first machine to record and reproduce sound) and key improvements to the motion picture camera. Edison’s impact went beyond individual inventions—he created entire industries, from electric power distribution to recorded music and film.
            </p>
            <h1 className='text-black tracking-[-1px] font-medium'>3. Nikola Tesla (1856–1943, Serbia/USA)</h1>
            <p>
              Tesla’s brilliance lies in his contributions to electricity and electromagnetism. He pioneered alternating current (AC), which powers the modern world, and developed the Tesla coil, radio wave technology, and early ideas of wireless power transmission. Though underappreciated in his lifetime, his visionary concepts—like wireless communication and renewable energy—proved him to be far ahead of his era. Today, Tesla is revered as a symbol of innovation and futuristic thinking.

              4. Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922, Scotland/USA)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Best known for inventing the telephone, Bell revolutionized global communication. His invention turned the world into a connected network, shaping business, politics, and personal life forever. Bell also made contributions in aviation, hydrofoils, and optical telecommunications. His work with the deaf community (inspired by his mother’s hearing impairment) also highlighted his humanitarian side, showing how invention can serve both science and society.

              5. Johannes Gutenberg (1400–1468, Germany)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Gutenberg’s invention of the mechanical printing press in the mid-15th century is considered one of the most transformative events in human history. By making books affordable and widely available, he fueled the spread of knowledge, literacy, and ideas, which directly led to the Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution. His press is often credited with democratizing information and laying the groundwork for the modern knowledge economy.

              6. James Watt (1736–1819, Scotland)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Watt’s improvements to the steam engine were pivotal in driving the Industrial Revolution. By enhancing efficiency and power, his innovations enabled factories, transportation (like railways and steamships), and mechanized agriculture to flourish. Watt’s work not only transformed industries but also reshaped societies, economies, and the environment, marking a significant shift from agrarian to industrialized life.

              7. Wright Brothers (Orville Wright: 1871–1948, Wilbur Wright: 1867–1912, USA)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Orville and Wilbur Wright are credited with inventing and successfully flying the world’s first powered, controlled airplane in 1903. Their achievement forever changed human transportation, shrinking the globe by making long-distance travel possible. They combined deep scientific experimentation with practical mechanical skills, and their relentless pursuit of controlled flight ushered in the age of aviation, military air power, and commercial airlines.

              8. Marie Curie (1867–1934, Poland/France)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Although primarily known as a scientist, Curie can also be regarded as an inventor because of her groundbreaking work on radioactivity. She discovered the elements polonium and radium, and her research led to the development of X-ray machines, radiation therapy for cancer, and nuclear science. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry). Her work continues to save lives today.

              9. Tim Berners-Lee (1955–Present, UK)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN. His creation of web browsers, HTML, and the concept of hyperlinks transformed the internet into a user-friendly global platform. By making the internet accessible to ordinary people, he revolutionized communication, commerce, education, and entertainment. Without his invention, the digital age as we know it—social media, e-commerce, streaming—would not exist.

              10. Steve Jobs (1955–2011, USA)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Jobs was not a traditional inventor but an innovator and visionary entrepreneur who redefined personal technology. As co-founder of Apple, he helped create the Macintosh computer, iPod, iPhone, and iPad—devices that reshaped entire industries. His genius lay in combining design, functionality, and user experience. Jobs’ legacy is a world where technology is not just useful but also personal, intuitive, and beautiful.
